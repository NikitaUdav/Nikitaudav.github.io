            his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
            About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of
            buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed,
            tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals
            was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait,
            uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of
            interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing
            can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living
            flesh which no dam could contain.

            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms;
            but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry,
            remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
            please the buffaloes to get out of the way.

            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by
            in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu!
            I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
            programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the
            locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
